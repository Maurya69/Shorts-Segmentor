197.0,205.0,"All the answers being different, the king agreed with none of them, and gave the reward to none."

333.0,342.0,"I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions, if you can give me none, tell me so, and I'll return home."
342.0,347.0,"Here comes someone running, said the hermit, let us see who it is."
347.0,352.0,"The king turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the wood."
352.0,358.0,"The man held his hands, pressed against his stomach, and blood was flowing from under them."

430.0,442.0,"When he awoke in the morning, it was long before he could remember where he was, or who was the strange bearded man lying on the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes."
443.0,451.0,"Forgive me, said the bearded man, in a weak voice, when he saw that the king was awake and was looking at him."
452.0,457.0,"I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for, said the king."
457.0,461.0,"You do not know me, but I know you."
461.0,470.0,I am that enemy of yours who swore to revenge himself on you because you executed his brother and seized his property.
470.0,477.0,"I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back."
477.0,480.0,"But the day passed, and you didn't return."
480.0,489.0,"So I came out from my ambush to find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized me and wounded me."
489.0,495.0,"I escaped from them, but should have bled to death had you not dressed my wound."
495.0,499.0,"I wished to kill you, and you have saved my life."
499.0,509.0,"Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and will bid my sons to do the same."
509.0,512.0,Forgive me.
512.0,528.0,"The king was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and to have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said he would send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and promised to restore his property."
528.0,537.0,"Having taken leave of the wounded man, the king went out into the porch and looked round for the hermit."
537.0,542.0,Before going away he wished once more to beg and answer to the questions he'd put.
542.0,550.0,"The hermit was outside, on his knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before."
550.0,558.0,"The king approached him and said, for the last time I pray you to answer my questions, wise man."
559.0,568.0,"You have already been answered, said the hermit, still crouching on his thin legs, and looking up at the king who stood before him."
568.0,572.0,"How answered, what do you mean, said the king?"
572.0,575.0,"Do you not see, replied the hermit?"
575.0,588.0,"If you had not pitted my weakness yesterday, and had not dug those beds for me but had gone your way, that man would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not having stayed with me."
588.0,601.0,"So the most important time was when you were digging the beds, and I was the most important man, and to do me good was your most important business."
602.0,608.0,"Afterwards, when that man ran to us, the most important time was when you were attending to him."
608.0,614.0,"For if you had not bound up his wounds, he would have died without having made peace with you."
614.0,621.0,"So he was the most important man, and what you did for him was your most important business."
621.0,624.9160305343512,"Remember then, there is only one time that is important."
624.9160305343512,630.0,"Now, it is the most important time because it is the most important time."
630.0,634.0,Because it is the only time when we have any power.
634.0,644.0,"The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with anyone else."
644.0,655.0,"And the most important affair is to do him good, because for that purpose alone was man sent into this life."
